## Getting Started

1. **Familiarize Yourself:** Begin with [`article/part-I.md`](article/part-I.md). Read through the introduction and setup sections to ground your understanding.
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** Follow the checklist to create an AI-ready development workspace.
3. **Apply the Prompts:** Use the provided prompts as templates when interacting with your chosen AI assistant. Adapt them for your own projects—feel free to store your best prompts in a personal notes app or a versioned doc.
4. **Iterate and Refine:** Don’t expect perfection out of the gate. Instead, treat the AI as an iterative partner—feed it context, break down big problems, and continually review its outputs.
5. **Contribute Back:** Found a better workflow, prompt, or strategy? Open a pull request and help strengthen this resource for others.

## Principles

- **Human-in-the-loop:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for your expertise. Your context, judgment, and intent are paramount.
- **Transparency:** All advice is based on real-world experience and is designed to demystify practical use of AI for coders.
- **Modularity:** Each article stands alone but forms part of a stepwise methodology for leveling up your development workflow with AI.
